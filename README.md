## 📦 Order Management & Business Logic

### Complete Implementation
- **Order Placement**
  - Orders can be placed via `/orders` endpoint.
  - New customers are added automatically; existing customers can be reused.
  - Orders include linked `OrderItem` records for pizzas, drinks, and desserts.
  - **MANDATORY PIZZA RULE**: Every order must contain at least one pizza - customers cannot order only drinks/desserts.

- **Customer Tracking**
  - Customer information (name, email, phone, address, birthday) stored in database.
  - Pizza count per customer tracked for loyalty discounts.

- **Discounts**
  - 🎂 **Birthday discount**: Customer receives 1 FREE cheapest pizza + 1 FREE cheapest drink on their birthday.
  - 🏆 **Loyalty discount**: After 10 pizzas, customer gets 10% off all future orders.
  - 💸 **Discount codes**: One-time codes supported, marked as used after redemption.

- **Delivery Assignment**
  - Delivery personnel linked to postcode prefixes (`DeliveryZone` table).
  - SQL-based assignment selects an available courier for the matching zone.
  - 🚲 **Cooldown rule**: After each delivery, courier is unavailable for 30 minutes.
  - If no courier is available → system returns: *"No delivery person available"*.

### 🎯 Technical Implementation
- Complete order lifecycle management with database persistence
- Automated discount calculation and application
- Intelligent delivery assignment with geographic zones
- Comprehensive business rule enforcement
- Full transaction support with error handling and rollback capabilities
